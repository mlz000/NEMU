# ICS2015 Programming Assignment
This is a course work from NJU Introduction to Computer Systems. 

For the guide of this programming assignment, refer to [https://nju-ics.gitbooks.io/ics2015-programming-assignment/content/index.html](https://nju-ics.gitbooks.io/ics2015-programming-assignment/content/index.html)

Used C language to accomplish the x86 imitator running on Debian, which can support functions like simplified debugger, instruction system, memory management, interception and I/O.

## NEMU
NEMU(NJU Emulator) is a simple but complete full-system x86 emulator designed for teaching. It is the main part of this programming assignment. Small x86 programs can run under NEMU. The main features of NEMU include
* a small monitor with a simple debugger
 * single step
 * register/memory examination
 * expression evaluation with the support of symbols
 * watch point
 * backtrace
* CPU core with support of most common used x86 instructions in protected mode
 * real mode is not supported
 * x87 floating point instructions are not supported
* DRAM with row buffer and burst
* two-level unified cache
* IA-32 segmentation and paging with TLB
 * protection is not supported
* IA-32 interrupt and exception
 * protection is not supported
* 6 devices
 * timer, keyboard, VGA, serial, IDE, i8259 PIC
 * most of them are simplified and unprogrammable
* 2 types of I/O
 * port-mapped I/O and memory-mapped I/O

## testcase

Some small C programs to test the implementation of NEMU.

## kernel

This is the simplified version of Nanos(http://cslab.nju.edu.cn/opsystem). It is a uni-tasking kernel with the following features.
* 2 device drivers
 * Ramdisk
 * IDE
* ELF32 loader
* memory management with paging
* a simple file system
 * with fix number and size of files
 * without directory
* 6 system calls
 * open, read, write, lseek, close, brk
